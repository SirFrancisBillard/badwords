# Bad Words
Unfinished API for retrieving/checking types of swear words.

# How to use

It's really simple, for instance:

https://sirfrancisbillard.github.io/badwords/?input=fuck&type=single

would give you some JSON information about our favorite word "fuck."

### Type Field

The "type" field can be one of four things.

- "Single" returns info about a single word.
- "Scan" returns info about the vulgarity of a whole sentence, useful for censorship.
- "Filter" returns a list of words that match a certain filter.
- "TagList" returns a list of all filters.

# Have fun!
